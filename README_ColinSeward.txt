The biggest challenge I have had so far has been trying to find certain object methods such as
when I was looking for the way to speed up my character it took me awhile to find out that the
character had a velocity value that I could change. I knew how to go about changing the
speed but I did not have a good idea of where to go to find out about stuff like that that I have
not seen before.

I might tinker with some things in the future, because it is nice to have a playground already made
that I can mess around in instead of trying to do everything from scratch just to find out one thing.
Any change I would make would just be to mess around and learn to program different features.
