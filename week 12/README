WEEK 12

TASK 1: As the first task, have a "Score: " text on the screen and update it to show the current score value.

TASK 2: As the second task, have a coin appear randomly on the screen. You can find a coin sprite in the assets. Have the coin stay on the screen for a couple of seconds and then destroy itself. If the player picks up the coin, they should earn "1" score. Alternatively, you can also have the coin move on the screen from one side to the other like the enemies.

TASK 1: Tammy Kwok
TASK 2: Colin Seward
