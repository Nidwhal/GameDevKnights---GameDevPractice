DIG3480 Assignments

TASK 1: I want the player to move ONLY at the bottom half of the screen. It can still exit from right and left and appear on the other side, but it should not move below the bottom line of the screen and above the middle of the screen.

TASK 2: Create a second enemy type that has a different movement pattern and that spawns on a different time pattern than the first enemy.

TASK 1: Tammy Kwok
TASK 2: Colin Seward
